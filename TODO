* [18/29] Further improvements
  - [-] wysiwyg
    - [ ] Toolbar should work only if there is a range inside the preview
          (also the state checking)
    - [ ] expand selection to word boundaries, just as in textile
    - [ ] join lists on backspace/entf between lists
    - [ ] Firefox: fix checkState for one bold word
    - [ ] br tags should be top level, because Border expects that
          or alternatively change behavior of the node search within Border
          This would be the approach with a future since there might be other
          cases of nested nodes ( b>i, i>b would be different now, but should 
          be the same)
    - [X] handle delete key
    - [X] selecting all and pressing bold should bolden each (part of a) paragraph in turn

      - [X] chrome problems
        - [X] return at the end of a heading

        - [X] selecting all and deleting/overwriting it

        - [X] enter in the middle of a heading does not move the rest of the heading down
        - [X] selecting all by hand and deleting it leaves empty tags
              this is a result of the current implementation of checkIfDeletedAll

  - [X] on mode change clear selection (select something in ta
        -> preview -> ta selection should be gone)
  - [X] fix rare bug: updating preview in preview mode should not write textile into preview
        reproduce: load dev.html -> press any key -> wait

* [1/3] Bugs
  - [X] pressing enter at the end of a heading sets the cursor outside
    any paragraph
  - [ ] h1. * item1
        does not compile right
  - [ ] set cursor between _a and click italic two times -> not the
    same situation as before. Such two clicks should be idempotent

* [0/5] Consider
  - [ ] Partial list change should either
        change the whole list (currently wysiwyg)
        change part off the list (currently textile and the norm)
  - [ ] turn off url display in bottom (consider accessability, gollum
    has the same construct)
  - [ ] double click should work: use hover to change contentEditable
    value and remember selection
  - [ ] do not focus the textarea after toolbar action, so that the current select 
        is still selected and can be changed via the arrow keys
  - [ ] remove conflicting markup in textile in one line (means if you
    select a string with parts of it already marked bold and click the
    unselected bold button, the parts should be marked as bold as a whole)
    - [ ] bold
    - [ ] italic

* List of Firefox Bugs

- Selecting everything and pressing delete removes all content within the wysiwyg area
- doubleclicking a word does not select the Word itself but some
  whitespace left of it too
- pressing enter at the end of a heading lands outside any tag
- justify* does only work with contentEditable = true on body
- double click in textarea does not select the word if there is an element with contentEditable = true on the page

* List of Chrome Bugs

- pressing enter at the end of a heading lands inside a div
- backspacing into a different paragraph type will keep the 
  style of the backspaced paragraph with span tags
