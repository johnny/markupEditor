* [17/29] Further improvements
  - [-] publish project
    - [ ] documentation
    - [X] better static files handling:
    - [X] package files
      - [X] join and compress js files
    - [X] push to github
  - [X] decouple preview and data-modes
  - [-] wysiwyg
    - [ ] Toolbar should work only if there is a range inside the preview
          (also the state checking)
    - [ ] expand selection to word boundaries, just as in textile
    - [ ] join lists on backspace/entf between lists
    - [ ] Firefox: fix checkState for one bold word
    - [ ] br tags should be top level, because Border expects that
          or alternatively change behavior of the node search within Border
          This would be the approach with a future since there might be other
          cases of nested nodes ( b>i, i>b would be different now, but should 
          be the same)
    - [X] handle delete key
    - [X] selecting all and pressing bold should bolden each (part of a) paragraph in turn
    - [X] ignore special keyCodes on deletion
    - [X] on keyup check if the content is still in a valid block tag
      - [X] chrome problems
        - [X] return at the end of a heading
        - [X] backspace into another paragraph
              this will keep the style of the backspaced paragraph with span tags
      - [X] firefox problems
        - [X] selecting all and deleting/overwriting it
              overwriting with normal keys won't work
        - [X] respect the top blockformat on overwriting
        - [X] return at the end of a heading
        - [X] enter in the middle of a heading does not move the rest of the heading down
        - [X] selecting all by hand and deleting it leaves empty tags
              this is a result of the current implementation of checkIfDeletedAll

  - [X] fix joined file
  - [X] generalize spec helpers
  - [X] load editor from any html element
    - [X] optimize hiding and showing. use least possible dom calls
    - [X] dynamically change the toolbar. Each mode should define the
          visible fields. If save is visible is defined by the
          presence of the save setting. The order is defined in markupEditor and not
          changeable. It would confuse the user otherwise

  - [X] different toolbars for different modes.
  - [X] Fix bugs in textileCompiler
  - [X] get specs running in Firefox
    - [X] W: check if selection is in preview before calculating states
      and doing things: Firefox select text -> h1 -> p -> all gone

  - [X] abstract getStates
  - [X] update preview periodically (and track changes)
  - [X] prevent link click follow

        -> preview -> ta selection should be gone)
  - [X] fix rare bug: updating preview in preview mode should not write textile into preview
        reproduce: load dev.html -> press any key -> wait

* [1/3] Bugs
  - [X] pressing enter at the end of a heading sets the cursor outside
    any paragraph
  - [ ] h1. * item1
        does not compile right
  - [ ] set cursor between _a and click italic two times -> not the
    same situation as before. Such two clicks should be idempotent

* [0/5] Consider
  - [ ] Partial list change should either
        change the whole list (currently wysiwyg)
        change part off the list (currently textile and the norm)
  - [ ] turn off url display in bottom (consider accessability, gollum
    has the same construct)
  - [ ] double click should work: use hover to change contentEditable
    value and remember selection
  - [ ] do not focus the textarea after toolbar action, so that the current select 
        is still selected and can be changed via the arrow keys
  - [ ] remove conflicting markup in textile in one line (means if you
    select a string with parts of it already marked bold and click the
    unselected bold button, the parts should be marked as bold as a whole)
    - [ ] bold
    - [ ] italic

* List of Firefox Bugs

- Selecting everything and pressing delete removes all content within the wysiwyg area
- doubleclicking a word does not select the Word itself but some
  whitespace left of it too
- pressing enter at the end of a heading lands outside any tag
- justify* does only work with contentEditable = true on body
- double click in textarea does not select the word if there is an element with contentEditable = true on the page

* List of Chrome Bugs

- pressing enter at the end of a heading lands inside a div
- backspacing into a different paragraph type will keep the 
  style of the backspaced paragraph with span tags
