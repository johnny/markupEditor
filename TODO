* [5/11] Further improvements
  - [X] Fix bugs in textileCompiler
  - [X] get specs running in Firefox
    - [X] W: check if selection is in preview before calculating states
      and doing things: Firefox select text -> h1 -> p -> all gone
  - [X] formatBlock should select multiple paragraphs
  - [X] refactor to use prototypes
  - [X] abstract getStates
  - [-] publish project
    - [ ] documentation
    - [X] better static files handling:
    - [ ] package files
      - [ ] join and compress js files
    - [ ] push to github
  - [ ] update preview periodically (and track changes)
  - [ ] clean pasted text
  - [ ] Better Dialogs (for inspiration see gollum)
    - [ ] dialogs should be created on the fly
    - [ ] values for the selects should be defined by a method call
  - [ ] localization
  - [ ] different toolbars for different modes.

* [0/2] Bugs
  - [ ] Select Paragraph Box -> up and down arrows don't change the
    text, but they should
  - [ ] pressing enter at the end of a heading sets the cursor outside any paragraph

* [/] Consider
  - [ ] turn off url display in bottom (consider accessability, gollum
    has the same construct)
  - [ ] double click should work: use hover to change contentEditable
    value and remember selection
  - [ ] remove conflicting markup in textile in one line (means if you
    select a string with parts of it already marked bold and click the
    unselected bold button, the parts should be marked as bold as a whole)
    - [ ] bold
    - [ ] italic

* List of Firefox Bugs

  whitespace left of it too
- first paragraph in contentEditable cannot be changed
- pressing enter at the end of a heading does not create a new p tag
  (webkit too)
- justify* does only work with contentEditable = true on body
- double click in textarea does not select the word if there is an element with contentEditable = true on the page
