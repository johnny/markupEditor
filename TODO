  - [ ] wysiwyg
    - [ ] checkIfDeleteAll should work with holding a neutral key combined with a destructive action
          shift + letter for example
    - [ ] br tags should be top level, because Border expects that
          or alternatively change behavior of the node search within Border
          This would be the approach with a future since there might be other
          cases of nested nodes ( b>i, i>b would be different now, but should 
          be the same)

* [0/1] Bugs
  - [ ] set cursor between _a and click italic two times -> not the
    same situation as before. Such two clicks should be idempotent

* [0/6] Consider
  - [ ] should only setup sync between editors, that are initialized in the same collection
  - [ ] Partial list change should either
        change the whole list (currently wysiwyg)
        change part off the list (currently textile and the norm)
  - [ ] Delay checkState on mouseup/keyup
  - [ ] turn off url display in bottom (consider accessability, gollum
    has the same construct)
  - [ ] double click should work: use hover to change contentEditable
    value and remember selection
  - [ ] do not focus the textarea after toolbar action, so that the current select 
        is still selected and can be changed via the arrow keys
  - [ ] remove conflicting markup in textile in one line (means if you
    select a string with parts of it already marked bold and click the
    unselected bold button, the parts should be marked as bold as a whole)
    - [ ] bold
    - [ ] italic

* List of Firefox Bugs

- Selecting everything and pressing delete removes all content within the wysiwyg area
- doubleclicking a word does not select the Word itself but some
  whitespace left of it too
- pressing enter at the end of a heading lands outside any tag
- justify* does only work with contentEditable = true on body
- double click in textarea does not select the word if there is an element with contentEditable = true on the page

* List of Chrome Bugs

- pressing enter at the end of a heading lands inside a div
- backspacing into a different paragraph type will keep the 
  style of the backspaced paragraph with span tags
